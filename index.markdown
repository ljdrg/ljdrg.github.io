## What is git?

Git is a version control system which helps you to keep your work well-structured and save. It notices conflicts between changes made by different people and synchronizes files between different computers.

Git works with repositories. A repository consists of two parts: (1) your project (your files and directories that you create and edit directly) and (2) the extra information that Git records about the projectâ€™s history.
