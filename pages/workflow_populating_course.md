## Workflow

1. Create template repositories for your course content with the same structure you want your assignments to have. 
2. Create assignments for each of the six course weeks. 
3. Use the template repositories which contain all necessary course materials when creating the assignments.
4. Upload student roster (csv or text file).
5. Provide the invite link for the assignments to students. See: [uploading student roster](/getting_started_with_GHCR.html/#adding-a-student-roster)
6. Students have to accept assignments and when accepting their first assignment, select their student identifier.

## Template Repositories in GitHub Classroom

Template repositories will make your life easy when wanting to populate your course and to reuse the contents for another course. You can find the documentation on how to create one here: [Template Repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository).
When creating a new assignment you're going to choose a template repository that you created before.

Another way to use the contents of an already existing classroom for a new course is copying them directly in the GitHub Classroom interface. Click on the three dots in the upper right corner of the classroom tile. Then click on "reuse assignments". Indicate to which course and classroom you want to copy the assignments to and select the ones you want to copy.
