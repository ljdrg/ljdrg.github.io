After finishing the creation of an assignment, you have to share the invitation link of the assignment with your students. Simply copy the URL and provide it to your students via the Canvas page. After students have accepted the invitation to the classroom via mail, they can then directly accept the GitHub assignment through Canvas. 

Your students then have to clone the repository before they can start working on it. Once they are done they have to add, commit and push their assignments to the GitHub Classroom assignment repository. If you want the students to submit the assignment via Canvas, set the submission type for the Canvas assignment to "website". This way, students can enter the URL of their GitHub repository and submit their work in Canvas. Also, students do not have to resubmit their assignments in Canvas. When they submit the link to their repositories, any changes they make in their repositories will be submitted directly with them.
