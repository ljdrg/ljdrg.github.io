## Version control system

Git is an open-source version control system which helps you to keep your work well-structured and save. It notices conflicts between changes made by different people and synchronizes files between different computers. 

## Repositories

Git works with repositories. A repository consists of two parts: (1) your project (your files and directories that you create and edit directly) and (2) the extra information that Git records about the project’s history.

So you want to create separate repository for your different project. In case of GitHub Classroom each of your students will get their own repository without affecting the repositories of other students.

## GitHub

GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories. Anyone can sign up and create a GitHub account for free. You can create private and public repositories create organizations or become a member in one.

## GitHub organization

A GitHub organization is an umbrella account on GitHub where you can store all your repositories. The organization you choose for your classroom is the place where all of your student’s assignment repositories will live. Each student will have their own assignment repository where they will do their work in.
