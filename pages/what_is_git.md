## Version control system

Git is a version control system which helps you to keep your work well-structured and save. It notices conflicts between changes made by different people and synchronizes files between different computers.

## GitHub organization

An organization is an umbrella account on GitHub where you can store all your repositories. The organization you choose for your classroom is the place where all of your student’s assignment repositories will live. Each student will have their own assignment repository where they will do their work in.

## Repositories

Git works with repositories. A repository consists of two parts: (1) your project (your files and directories that you create and edit directly) and (2) the extra information that Git records about the project’s history.
